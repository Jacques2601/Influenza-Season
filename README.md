# Influenza Season Staffing Plan ‚Äì U.S. Healthcare

This project was completed as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program. The objective was to develop a national staffing plan for U.S. hospitals and clinics during influenza season, using data-driven insights from historical mortality and vaccination trends.

## üìä Project Summary

Influenza-related deaths place a seasonal burden on the U.S. healthcare system, particularly among vulnerable populations aged 65 and older. This project aimed to identify high-risk states, peak flu months, and key demographic indicators to guide workforce planning for temporary medical staffing agencies.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Excel** ‚Äì Data cleaning, integration, and hypothesis testing  
- **Tableau** ‚Äì Visualizations of flu trends, age demographics, and state-level mortality  
- **Data Sources**:
  - CDC Flu Mortality Data
  - U.S. Census Age Demographics
  - CDC Flu Vaccination Survey (Children)

## üîç Process Overview

1. **Data Cleaning & Integration**  
   Merged datasets on flu deaths, population age distribution, and vaccination rates.

2. **Exploratory & Statistical Analysis**  
   Identified strong correlation between mortality and 65+ age group. Detected seasonal trends peaking in Q1, especially January.

3. **Visualization**  
   Created dashboards in Tableau to display seasonal spikes, high-risk states, and staffing recommendations.

## üß† Key Insights

- Over **90% of flu-related deaths** occur in the 65+ population.
- Peak season is **January to March**, with **January** being the most critical.
- **California, Florida, and New York** consistently rank highest in flu mortality and 65+ population size.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Begin staffing preparation in **September** with targeted training.
- Deploy additional staff in **Q1**, prioritizing high-risk states.
- Increase flu shot outreach efforts in regions with low child vaccination rates.
